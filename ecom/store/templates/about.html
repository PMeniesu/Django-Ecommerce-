                OBJECTIVES
                1. If Statements: Understand conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else`. Explore
                logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) for complex conditions.
                2. Lists: Lists allow you to store sets of information in one place, whether you have just a
                few items or millions of items. Lists are one of Pythonâ€™s most powerful features readily
                accessible to new programmers, and they tie together many important concepts in
                programming.
                3. Loops (for and while): Learn the `for` and `while` loops for iterating through
                sequences or executing code repeatedly. Discuss when to use each loop type.
                Challenges:
                1. FizzBuzz: Solve the classic FizzBuzz problem using control flow
                statements.
                2. List Manipulation
                <br/><br/>
                FizzBuzz Challenge
                Objective:- Gain hands-on experience with control flow statements in Python.
                Instructions:
                1. Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
                2. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
                3. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
                4. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
                5. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 100.- Ensure your program follows the FizzBuzz rules mentioned above.- Submit the completed Python script.
               Note: This assignment aims to reinforce your understanding of control flow statements
                such as `if`, `elif`, and `else` in Python.

                List Manipulation Challenge
                Objective:- Strengthen your understanding of working with lists in Python.
                Instructions:
                1. Create an initial list containing at least 7 different types of fruits.
                2. Perform the following operations on the list:- Add two more fruits to the end of the list and print it.- Remove any one fruit of your choice from the list and print it.- Print the third and fifth fruits in the updated list.- Check if "Banana" is in the list and print a message accordingly.- Find and print the length of the list.- Sort the list in alphabetical order and print it.- Create a new list with three different fruits and concatenate it with the
                original list and print it.- Submit the completed Python script.
                Note: This assignment is designed to enhance your skills in manipulating
                lists, including adding, removing, accessing elements, checking
                membership, finding length, sorting, and concatenation.
